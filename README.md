# Advent of Code 2021

This time I'll try to write it in bash

File extensions:

* `.txt`: Input files
* `.sh`: Shell, run in bash but is probably POSIX compliant
* `.bash`: Bash shell, certainly not POSIX

File stems:

* `day1a`: First part of day 1
* `day1b`: Second part of day 1

Usage:

```
cat day1.txt | bash day1a.sh
```
